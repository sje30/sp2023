## Moodle

[Moodle](https://www.vle.cam.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=253091) will
 store the links to the lecture recordings, and the assignment
 submission system.
 
Due to a problem with the timetable rescheduling, the lectures on
2023-10-09 were not automatically captured.  I have added the Teams
recordings from 2022 for these lectures onto Moodle -- starting at about 18
minutes into "SP05" and finishing about 40 mins in "SP07".  These can
be found on the moodle site.

There is also an online recording of the latex lecture which I don't
plan to give this year.  <https://github.com/sje30/latex101>
